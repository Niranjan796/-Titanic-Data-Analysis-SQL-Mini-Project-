# 🚢 Titanic Data Analysis (SQL Mini Project)

## 📌 Project Overview  
This mini project analyzes the famous **Titanic dataset** using SQL. The dataset contains details about passengers such as age, gender, class, fare, and survival status, etc.  
The objective is to perform **data exploration and analysis** with SQL queries to uncover meaningful insights about passengers and their survival patterns.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies  
- **Dataset**: Titanic.csv (Rows-714 && Columns-12) 
- **Database**: MySQL Workbench 8.0 CE
- **Language**: SQL

## 🔍 Key Analysis Performed  

1. **Passenger distribution by travel class (Pclass)**  
2. **Total number of passengers on Titanic**  
3. **Average age of passengers**  
4. **Gender distribution (male vs female)**  
5. **Survival rate by gender**  
6. **Cabins with the most survivors**  
7. **Categorization of passengers into Economy, Business, and First Class**  
8. **Ranking passengers by fare within each class using Window Functions**  
9. **Finding the minimum fare paid in each class**

## 📊 SQL Concepts Covered  
- **SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY**  
- **Aggregate Functions** → COUNT, AVG, MIN  
- **CASE Statements**  
- **Window Functions** → RANK, DENSE_RANK, ROW_NUMBER  

---

## 📈 Insights Gained  
- More passengers traveled in **lower classes** compared to higher classes.  
- The majority of passengers were **male**, but **female passengers had a higher survival rate**.  
- Survival rates varied by **class and cabin type**.  
- Higher-class passengers often paid **higher fares**, showing strong variation in ticket pricing.
